## Write Some Pseudo-Code


## Potential Other Applications
* Scheduling - we already use this
* Hatching cycles - e.g. http://io9.gizmodo.com/5895840/why-do-cicadas-know-prime-numbers
* English Premiere League fixtures - every team plays each other twice, home and away.  There are 20 teams.  Every year three teams are relegated from and promoted to the league.  Games are played weekly.  How can you apply intervals to a season?
